          My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm Yoshikage Kira. My house is in the northeast section of Yoshikage Kira, where all the Yoshikage Kiras are, and I am not Yoshikage Kira. I work as an employee for the Yoshikage Kira department stores, and I get
          home every day by Yoshikage Kira at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally Yoshikage Kira. I'm in bed by Yoshikage Kira, and make sure I get eight hours of Yoshikage Kira, no matter what. After having a glass of Yoshikage Kira and
          doing about twenty minutes of Yoshikage Kira before going to Yoshikage Kira, I usually have no problems sleeping until Yoshikage Kira.
